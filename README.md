# Text-to-Emoji-Synthesis

This project implements Text to Emoji Synthesis using Deep Neural Networks. It involves the design and implementation of a modified version of the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) that is capable of carrying out Text to Emoji synthesis and improves the performance of models created by previous researchers in the field by applying methods that focus on improving Text-Image Alignment.
